# 3n-1
html+js+css page to represent the numbers in the 3n+1 conjecture (AKA. collatz or syracuse conjecture)


Download the html page and put a number of how many numbers you want to calculate (not more than 70 or it won't show everything cuz it's kind of buggy and i did it at like 3 in the morning)

Or visit the page http://kzhxchjkrtiv9nfx.myfritz.net/3n+1.html
